# SchemeEdit

https://jleath.github.io/SchemeEdit/

SchemeEdit is a Scheme editor for the browser.

The editor currently features basic syntax highlighting. It highlights Scheme 
keywords and number literals. I plan to add additional highlighting for bound names.

Pairs of matching parentheses will highlight if the cursor is immediately after the closing
parenthesis. Closing parentheses with no corresponding open parenthesis will highlight as well.

Moving the cursor and selecting text can only be done via the keyboard for now. I will be adding
the ability to use a mouse at some point.

I will also be adding the ability to change font styles (size, colors, etc.)
